## Employee Salary Predictor

This is a complete end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether an employee earns more than $50,000 per year based on their demographic and professional background. Built using the Adult Income Dataset, this project integrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

🎯 Project Goal

To design a predictive system that classifies employee salaries into two categories: above or below $50K. The model uses real-world attributes such as age, education, work hours, occupation, and more to make accurate predictions.

🚀 Key Features

🧠 Predict employee income category.
🧼 Automated data cleaning, feature encoding, and scaling.
📊 Intuitive data visualizations including box plots and bar charts.
📈 Performance metrics for all models: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
🎯 Outlier detection and data insights visualized for exploration.

🤖 Machine Learning Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

Each model is evaluated and compared for optimal performance.
